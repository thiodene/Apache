# Verify domain ownership (HTML or DNS)
# If needed, also change the .htaccess file an htaccess_http 
# (to validate a domain name -> no https and no redirect to www in .htaccess)

You will receive an email from us with a unique identifier, which will be in a line of the email: 
"Your unique ID for these methods is [uniqueID]."

    1. Use an app like Notepad or TextEdit to create a file named starfield.html.
   
    2. Copy your unique ID, and only your unique ID, into the file. For example, if your unique ID was 12345, 
    the content of your new .html file would be: 12345
    
    3. Create a directory named "/.well-known/pki-validation/" in the highest-level directory of the website for the common name you're using. 
    Usually, this is the website's root directory - for example, a directory named coolexample.com. For more info, 
    see What is my website's root directory?. 
    Note: If you are running a Windows server, 
    you will have to name the folder /.well-known./ instead of /.well-known/, 
    or your server won't let you create the folder.
    
    4. Place the new .html file in the pki-validation directory. 
    For example, after you place the file at that location, 
    the file's URL would be http://coolexample.com/.well-known/pki-validation/starfield.html.
    
    5. Verify that you can access starfield.html in a web browser, 
    and then use the instructions in the To Verify Your Domain Name Ownership section of this article.

If the SSL certificate is for the root domain, the HTML file must be findable at 
http://coolexample.com/.well-known/pki-validation/starfield.html. 
http://www.coolexample.com/.well-known/pki-validation/starfield.html will not work.
