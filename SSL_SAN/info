# SSL SAN: What is a Multi-Domain (SAN) Certificate?
# Multi-Domain Certificates, also called SAN certificates, offer complete control over the Subject Alternative Name field. 
# These certificates are ideal for securing multiple names across different domains and subdomains (e.g., Exchange/OCS environments). 
# You also have the option to add, change, and delete any of the SANs on the fly to reflect the evolving needs of your network.
