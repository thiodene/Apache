# How to generate a CSR file:
# royalambassador.key provided by Rebel.ca (Web Hosting company for obtaining SSL)
sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout royalambassador.key -out royalambassador.csr

# Now Enter the company info that have to match the info entered on Rebel.ca to generate the Key:
# Common Name: www.royalambassador.ca
# Organization: Royal Ambassador Event Centre Inc
# Organization Unit: 
# Country: CA
# Region: Ontario
# Locality: Caledon
# Email: john@royalambassador.ca
# Key Length: 2048
# Postcode: L7C 2Z1

# The input has to be royalambassador.key
# The output will be royalambassador.csr
# Once the output csr is generated send it on Rebel.ca for GlobalSign to authorize and generate the SSL Certificate (Few days to wait) 
# and you will receive the files: 
# X509.cert, ROOT.cert, INTER.cert, PKCS7.cert

# use X509.cert and rename it www_royalambassador.crt
# if needed use INTER.cert and rename it www_royalambassador_int.crt
# you already have the file: www_royalambassador.key (obtained online to generate the csr file)
# you already have the file: www_royalambassador.csr generate on apache from the above key
# now you have everything you need to install SSL after putting these files in the relevant folder:
