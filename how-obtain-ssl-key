How do I generate a CSR Key file?

If your domain is hosted on our Rebel server you can obtain the CSR key by following these steps:

Step 1.
Login to your Rebel account and click Hosting Manager.

Step 2.
Click the green button that reads Control Panel. This will open the Hosting OS in a new tab.

Step 3.
Under Sections click SSL then click CSR.

Step 4.
Complete your organizational details then click Generate. (view picture)
Generate will give you a key that will be renamed www_royalambassador.key (useful also at the end while generating the SSL certificate)

If your domain is not hosted with Rebel you will need to contact 
your hosting service provider so that they can provide you with the CSR key for your website.

From this key go to Apache to generate the SSL CSR file
